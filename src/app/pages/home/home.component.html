                Developing robust and scalable backend applications is my expertise. 
                With Spring Boot, I build RESTful APIs, manage data persistence with JPA & Hibernate, 
                and implement secure authentication using Spring Security. 
                My focus is on performance, maintainability, and clean architecture.

                I have experience designing and managing relational databases using PostgreSQL. 
                I focus on writing optimized SQL queries, indexing strategies, and ensuring data integrity. 
                I also work with ORMs like Hibernate and query optimization techniques for high-performance applications.
